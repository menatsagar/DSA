Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers, convert that array into a min heap and return the array.

NOTE: A min heap is a binary tree where every node has a value less than or equal to its children.



Problem Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 105

0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 109



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains a single integer array A of length N.



Output Format
Return the reordered array A such that it forms a min heap.



Example Input
Input:

A = [5, 13, -2, 11, 27, 31, 0, 19]


Example Output
Output:

A = [-2, 5, 0, 13, 11, 19, 27, 31]


Example Explanation
One possible Heap is
  
                -2
               /    \
             5       0
            / \    /  \
          13  11  19   27
          /
        31

It can be seen that each parent has a value smaller than its children. Hence it is a Valid Heap.

The Heap in the Array format is [-2, 5, 0, 13, 11, 19, 27, 31].

Some more possible heaps are  [-2, 0, 5, 13, 11, 27, 19, 31], [-2, 5, 0, 11, 27, 13, 19, 31], etc. 
You can return any possible Valid Heap Structure.
